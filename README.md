# Multilayer Perceptron and KNN Model

● Modeled a multilayer perceptron using only the Numpy library in Python.
● Implemented backtracking as well as activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh and ReLu.
● Performed functions like one hot encoding without the use of Scikit-Learn library.
● Also developed a KNN model from scratch
